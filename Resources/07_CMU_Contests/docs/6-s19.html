<h1>15-295: Competition Programming and Problem Solving, Spring 2019</h1>

<p>In this course you will learn the techniques and skills needed to
solve algorithmic programming contests problems such as those that
appear on the <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/">ACM ICPC</a>,
<a href="http://www.codeforces.com">Codeforces</a>, and
<a href="https://www.topcoder.com/community/events/">Topcoder</a>.
Most of your time will be spent writing programs on your own
to solve problems.</p>

<p>Some students may go on to participate in the <a href="http://acm-ecna.ysu.edu/">ACM ECNA regional
event</a> (which occurs in the fall) and
possibly even the <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/">World Finals</a> (which
occurs in the spring).</p>

<p>But the skills you will pick up from the course are far more valuable
than just enabling you to win contests.  Many of the algorithms and
techniques are classic ones that every computer scientist should know.
You will also learn to think about algorithms in a deeper way, because
many of the problems require you have to devise a new algorithm, not
just apply a classic one.  These skills will be of great value in your
other classes, in your job interviews, and in your future work.</p>

<h2>Weekly Problem Sets</h2>

<p>Most problem sets will have a theme announced in advance, along with
links so you can learn about the material before class if you want.
There may be an occasional "mini-lecture" in the classroom from 6 to
6:30, before the contest starts.  The mini-lecture will cover the
theme topic for the contest, and be announced via email in advance.</p>

<p>The weekly contests will take place on Codeforces.  They are
classified under a "Codeforces Group" called
<a href="http://codeforces.com/group/KIrM1Owd8u/contests">15-295</a>.  Click on
this link to see a list of contests for this course and to participate
in it.</p>

<p>The point values of the problems for each weekly contest are tabulated
below, along with a solutions page which is based on contributions from
students and staff in the class.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>This course is 5 units.  Each week you will be given several problems
to try to solve during class.  You will be allowed (for half credit)
to solve these problems during the week after the contest ends.  You
can also get credit for solving problems during rated contests on
Codeforces.  (This site run rated contests approximately every two
weeks.)</p>

<p>Let me be more specific.  Each problem that we give has some number of
points between 0.5 and 3. Let X be the total number of points of the
problems you solve in class.  Let X' be the total number points of the
problems you solve in the week after class.  Let Y be the number of
Codeforces problems you solve.  (Y only counts problems B, C,
etc. (NOT A, they're too easy, and not Div 3) solved during rated contests.
Virtual contests are not rated.)  Your score in the course is X + X'/2 + Y.</p>

<p>Here is how your grade is determined:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>score &ge; 25: A <br>
score &ge; 15: B <br>
score &ge; 10: C <br>
score &ge; &nbsp; 5: D <br></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>You can make use of generic on-line resources while solving problems.
These include things like language documentation, API documentation,
algorithm descriptions, terminology, etc.  You should not search for
or make use of code written by others to solve the specific assigned
problem.</p>

<p>If you're stuck on a problem, you are welcome to discuss it with
another student in the class, or the course staff.  Keep the level
down so as not to disturb those around you.</p>

<h2>Logistics</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Everyone in 15-295 and/or on any programming team should be in 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/15-295">http://groups.google.com/group/15-295</a>.
This is how we communicate with the class.</p></li>
<li><p>Everybody in the class is required to have a Codeforces account.  We
will be running our weekly contests on the Codeforces website via a
mechanism called "mashups".  If you do not already have an account
on Codeforces, <a href="http://codeforces.com/register">please create one</a>.
And add your name along with your Codeforces handle name to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tWjlRmtl_YHbZOusQ9wNbqGzEJL_QVUKqI-FZvopEeA/edit?usp=sharing">this
google doc</a>.
(It's the same one in Basic Information list above.)</p></li>
<li><p>To join the 15-295 codeforces group, first create your codeforces account.
Then go to this <a href="http://codeforces.com/group/KIrM1Owd8u/contests">15-295
Codeforces Group</a>
page.  On this page you should see a list of the contests created for
this course.</p>

<p>After you've logged in with your codeforces account and clicked the
link above to get to the group page, toward the right side of the
page click on the link to join the group.  (You only have to join
once.)  Then a "Register" link should appear next to the contest.
Click on this link to register for the contest.  After that another
"Enter" link should be available for you to join the contest (if it
has already started).</p></li>
<li><p>As we proceed through the semester we will tabulate your results and put them into
the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1svvoQY1laaQfZDucPVsIuNcrnIXs7u_BpwBv2T_T5FM/edit?usp=sharing">grades</a>
document mentioned above.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a laptop bring it to class.  If you don't you will have
to work in one of the clusters.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>In case you're unfamiliar with how to deal with standard input
and standard output,
<a href="../tutorials/stdin-out-in-all-languages.txt">here is a link</a>
to a document showing the solution to a problem in several different languages.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cses.fi/book.pdf">Competitive Programmer's Handbook</a> by
Antti Laaksonen covers (perhaps somewhat superficially) many topics
that come up in competitive programming.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/">E-Maxx Algorithms in English</a> is
a great source on many algorithms.  It includes algorithm descriptions,
analysis and code in C++.</p>

<p><a href="../f18">Last semester's course</a> has links to the topics for each
of those contests, as well as solutions to many of the problems.</p>

<p>A way to get started and to improve is via the <a href="http://train.usaco.org/usacogate">USACO training
site</a>.  They've developed a series
of lessons along with corresponding problems.  It will take you from a
beginner to a strong contest programmer.</p>

<p>There are a number of excellent tutorials on the algorithms and
techniques needed to solve these kinds of contest programs on
<a href="https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/">Topcoder's Data Science Tutorials web
site</a>.</p>

<p>You can also do old problems on codeforces.  Just go to
<a href="codeforces.com/contests">codeforces.com/contests</a> and click "enter"
on any of the contests.  You can then try solving problems.  You can
also go to the scoreboard of the contest and click on other people's
solutions to see their code.  This is a great way to learn.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact (email or stop by) the instructor or the TA any time
to discuss problems, including during class.</p>

<p>Here are a few tutorials about important algorithms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="../tutorials/seg_tree.txt">A segment tree implementation and tutorial</a>. <br>
<a href="../tutorials/range_tree.txt">Range Trees (AKA Fenwick Trees)</a> <br>
<a href="../tutorials/min-cost-flow.txt">Lecture Notes about min cost flow, along with an implementaiton.</a> <br>
