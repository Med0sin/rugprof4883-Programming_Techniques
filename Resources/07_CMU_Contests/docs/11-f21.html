<h1>Competition Programming and Problem Solving</h1>

<h2>15-195 and 15-295 Fall 2021</h2>

<p>In this course you will learn the techniques and skills needed to
solve algorithmic programming contests problems such as those that
appear on the <a href="http://icpc.global/">ICPC</a>,
<a href="http://www.codeforces.com">Codeforces</a>, <a href="https://dmoj.ca/">DMOJ</a>, and
<a href="https://www.topcoder.com/community/events/">Topcoder</a>.  Most of your
time will be spent writing programs on your own to solve problems.</p>

<p>Some students may go on to participate in the <a href="http://acm-ecna.ysu.edu/">ECNA regional
event</a>, the <a href="http://nac.icpc.global/">ICPC North America
Championship</a>, and possibly even the <a href="https://icpc.global/">ICPC
World Finals</a>.  The date for the ECNA Regional
is Saturday, February 26th 2022.  The event will take place in person,
probably in Cincinnati Ohio.</p>

<p>But the skills you will pick up from the course are far more valuable
than just enabling you to win contests.  Many of the algorithms and
techniques are classic ones that every computer scientist should know.
You will also learn to think about algorithms in a deeper way, because
many of the problems require you have to devise a new algorithm, not
just apply a classic one.  You will also become highly fluent in a
programming language of your choice.  These skills will be of great
value in your other classes, in your job interviews, and in your
future work.</p>

<h3>Week #13 - Geometry</h3>

<p>Geometry! Love it or hate it! Geometry problems are often some of the
most difficult problems that appear in programming competitions
because they can be full of corner cases, precision, and rounding
issues. This week, we will practice the fundamental techniques behind
solving geometry problems.</p>

<h3>Week #11 - Advanced Data Structures</h3>

<p>This week we will cover some advanced data structures that you won't find in your
language's standard library.  We'll learn to maintain disjoint sets under the union
and find operation.  We'll learn about lowest common ancestors in trees, and ranged minimum
queries over arrays.  It turns out that these two very different-sounding problems
can actually be reduced to one another and hence we can use the same data structures
to solve them. We'll also talk briefly about Euler-tours and Reachability trees.

<h3>Week #9 -- Applications of Maximum Flow</h3>

<p>This week, we will explore even more graph algorithms. In particular, we will be looking
at applications of maximum network flow. One key difference compared to prior weeks is that
we will not actually focus on the algorithms for maximum flow (you should learn these in
your algorithms courses), but rather on the applications. It is therefore crucial that
you have a working implementation of a maximum flow algorithm ready to go before this
week's contest begins. A maximum flow code is an important component of any competitive
programmer's code library. If you have not learned a maximum flow algorithm before and
can not implement one yourself, you are allowed to use a prewritten implementation by
someone else. I will provide you with a sample C++ implementation that you are welcome
to use. The first of the practice problems this week will help you check your
implementation, as it simply asks you to compute a maximum flow in a graph, and not
solve any particular application. It is strongly recommended that you do this to avoid
getting wrong answers during the contest due to a bug in your flow code.</p>

<h3><a name="week06"></a> Week #6 -- Shortest Paths in Graphs</h3>

<p>This week, we will continue the theme of graph algorithms and talk
about shortest path problems in graphs. The fundamental algorithms
that you will need to learn to solve these kinds of problems are
breadth-first search (mentioned last time) and Dijkstra's algorithm.
Other algorithms, such as Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall are also
very useful.</p>

<h3>Week #5: Graph Traversal</h3>

<p>This week we will talk about graph algorithms. This is a topic that
will probably span multiple weeks as we cover things like shortest
paths, minimum spanning trees, and network flows. For this week, we
will focus on the fundamentals, and cover things like how to represent
graphs and how to implement graph traversal algorithms (breadth first
search and depth first search).</p>

<h3>Week #4: Dynamic programming</h3>

<p>This week, we will practice the use of dynamic programming (DP) as a technique to solve
programming competition problems. DP is quite possibly the most frequently occuring
algorithmic technique used in competitions, with every ICPC contest always featuring
at least one, if not several problems that require it. Mastering this technique is key
to becoming a strong competitive programmer. DP revolves around two key concepts,
<em>optimal substructure</em>, which means that a problem can be solved by breaking it into
smaller versions of itself (much in the same way as divide and conquer), and
<em>memoization of overlapping subproblems</em>, which means to cache the solutions to
the smaller problems in case they need to be solved multiple times. Of all topics in
competitive programming, it probably requires the most practice in order to master, so get started!</p>

<h3>Week #3: Binary Search</h3>

<p>This week, we will solve problems that use the <em>binary search</em> technique. You might think
of binary search as an algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list, but it is actually
a much more general technique than that, and can be used to solve a wide range of problems.
Essentially, binary search allows you to solve problems where you must minimize or maximize
some quantity subject to some contraint, as long as that constraint is monotone. A constraint
is monotone if it is true/false for all values of x up to some value, and then becomes false/true
after that value. Binary search allows us to efficiently find this partition point, and hence
solve the corresponding optimization problem. The practice problems this week should help you
to learn to apply this powerfull technique.</p>

<h3>Week #2: Built-in Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>

<p>This week, we will focus on the most commonly used and fundamental algorithms and data
structures in competitive programming. We will review and
practice using arrays, binary search trees, hashtables, and priority
queues. Knowing and understanding how to use these data structures
in your favourite programming language is crucial to being able to
quickly implement solutions to problems. We will mainly use C++ to
demonstrate, but the ideas should be applicable to any language that
supports these data structures.</p>

<h3>Week #1: Introduction</h3>

<p>This week has no particular algorithmic theme. Instead, we will go
over the basics of competitive programming and do our first contest on
Codeforces. Please make sure you have a Codeforces account ready to go
and understand how to upload your solutions to the problems.  You
should do some practice problems to get the hang of writing and
submitting solutions to the Codeforces system.</p>

<p>We have created a practice contest to do just that.  So go to <a href="https://codeforces.com/group/KIrM1Owd8u/contests">this
page</a> and (1) join
the group (right side) (2) register for the contest and (3) enter the
contest.  Then you will find three problems you can try to solve.  The
are: <em>Lights in the Morning</em>, <em>Deconstructed Password</em> and <em>Fine-tuned
Resistance</em>.<br /></p>

<h2><a name="rules"></a> Rules and Academic Integrity</h2>

<p>You can make use of generic on-line resources while solving problems.
These include things like language documentation, API documentation,
algorithm descriptions, terminology, etc.  You <em>are allowed</em> to use
any code you have written, at any time in the past, for any purpose.
However, you <em>should not</em> search for or make use of code written by
others to solve the specific assigned problem.  You're allowed to
copy somewhat standard pieces of code (e.g. a primality test) that
you find on-line or in a book.</p>

<p>So to summarize, each student should write his or her own code.  If
you're stuck on a problem, you are welcome to discuss it with another
student in the class, or the course staff.  But you cannot copy
another student's code.</p>

<p>The violations described above are regarded as an academic integrity
violation, and -- depending on the severity -- will result in
penalties and/or be reported to the appropriate university
authorities.</p>

<h2><a name="grading"></a> Grading</h2>

<p>This course is 5 units.  Each week you will be given several problems
to try to solve during class.  You will be allowed (for half credit)
to solve these problems during the week after the contest ends.  You
can also get credit for solving problems during rated contests on
Codeforces.  (This site run rated contests approximately every two
weeks.)</p>

<p>To be more specific, you can earn points from the following sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>Solving problems during the in-class contests. Each problem you
solve is worth one point</li>
<li>Solving problems from the in-class contests during the week
following the contest. Each problem solved in this way is worth 0.5
points</li>
<li>Solving problems during rated competitions on Codeforces. Division 3
contests and Problem A from Division 2 contests are not counted. You
will earn one point for each problem solved.</li>
</ul>

<p>The differences between 15-195 and 15-295 are:
Students enrolled in 15-295 will not get credit for problems A and B
of the weekly contests, but 15-195 students can.  A student can take
15-195 only once, but 15-295 can be taken repeatedly.</p>

<p>Here is how your grade is determined:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>score &ge; 25: A <br>
score &ge; 15: B <br>
score &ge; 10: C <br>
score &ge; &nbsp; 5: D <br></p>

<li>Everybody in the class is required to have a Codeforces account.  We
will be running our weekly contests on the Codeforces website via a
mechanism called "mashups".  If you do not already have an account
on Codeforces, <a href="http://codeforces.com/register">please create one</a>.
And add your name along with your Codeforces handle name to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XQ8qH2Q81oEpGDSpGpHBjXgWnWAed3swmENIdP6w29k/edit?usp=sharing">this
spreadsheet</a>.
(It's the same one in Basic Information list above.)</li>
<li>To join the 15-295 codeforces group, first create your codeforces account.
Then go to this <a href="http://codeforces.com/group/KIrM1Owd8u/contests">15-295
Codeforces Group</a>
page.  On this page you should see a list of the contests created for
this course.
After you've logged in with your codeforces account and clicked the
link above to get to the group page, toward the right side of the
page click on the link to join the group.  (You only have to join
once.)  Then a "Register" link should appear next to the contest.
Click on this link to register for the contest.  After that another
"Enter" link should be available for you to join the contest (if it
has already started).</li>
<li>As we proceed through the semester we will tabulate your results and put them into
this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSgv5f6yggkfeCElY6zL4RNg-xedn57W7L3HRB8XhGganrNVdj2cpoJYX4ECg9VHX2N5tbHIXCY_f01/pubhtml?gid=1116657803&amp;single=true">grades</a>

<h2><a name="training"></a> Training Resources</h2>

<p>First of all if you need help reading from standard input, or writing to
standard output, see <a href="../tutorials/stdin-out-in-all-languages.txt">this link</a>.</p>

<p>There are many online resources available for you to train with if you intend
to become a serious competitive programmer. You can find thousands of practice problems
for you practice and improve your skills. Some good places to find practice
problems include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codeforces.com">Codeforces</a>: We use Codeforces for all of our in-class contests.
On the Codeforces website, you can choose to solve individual problems from their old contests at your leisure, do
a "virtual contest", in which you will be given a time limit to solve a set of problems
from an old contest, or you can participate in real live contests roughly once per week.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/how-to-compete">Topcoder</a>: Topcoder also hosts
live contests and allows you to practice on problems from their old contests. You need to install
their Java applet in order to browse and solve problems, however.</li>
<li><a href="https://onlinejudge.org/">UVA Online Judge</a>: UVA has a huge database of problems, many from
past ICPC contests. A good website for finding particular problems to focus on is <a href="https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/0">uHunt</a>,
which catalogues problems from UVA Online Judge into convenient categories for you to focus on (e.g. data structures problems,
graph problems, string problems, etc.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.spoj.com/">SPOJ</a>: SPOJ has a big database of practice problems that you can use. You can search for
problems by tags to find ones that focus on a specific topic.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.codechef.com">CodeChef</a>: Codechef has a number of practice problems that are categorized by difficulty,
so you can work your way up from easy problems to hard problems as you progress. You can also search by tags to find
problems that focus on specific topics.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="learning"></a> Learning Material</h2>

<p>If you are a beginner looking for resources to learn the various topics that appear in typical contests, some
good sources are:</p>

<h2><a name="diversity"></a> Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h2>

<p><em>We must treat every individual with respect.</em> We are diverse in many
ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an
equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to
multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to
race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual
orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief,
veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse
identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the
perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We,
at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only
because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want
to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also
fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of
building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces
these core values.</p>

<p>Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether
intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an
unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the
university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who
experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of
identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of
the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these
experiences using the following resources:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li>Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: &lt;<a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6C;&#116;&#x6F;:&#99;&#115;&#100;&#x69;&#64;&#97;&#x6E;dr&#x65;&#x77;&#x2E;&#x63;m&#x75;&#x2E;&#101;&#100;&#117;">&#99;&#115;&#100;&#x69;&#64;&#97;&#x6E;dr&#x65;&#x77;&#x2E;&#x63;m&#x75;&#x2E;&#101;&#100;&#117;</a>>, (412) 268-2150 </br ></li>
<li>Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: <a href="http://reportit.net">reportit.net</a> username: tartans password: plaid </br ></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there
should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the
university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus
climate to be more equitable and just.</p>
