<h1>Competition Programming and Problem Solving</h1>

<h2>15-295 Spring 2020</h2>

<p>In this course you will learn the techniques and skills needed to
solve algorithmic programming contests problems such as those that
appear on the <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/">ACM ICPC</a>,
<a href="http://www.codeforces.com">Codeforces</a>, and
<a href="https://www.topcoder.com/community/events/">Topcoder</a>.
Most of your time will be spent writing programs on your own
to solve problems.</p>

<p>Some students may go on to participate in the <a href="http://acm-ecna.ysu.edu/">ACM ECNA regional
event</a> (which occurs in the fall), the
<a href="http://nac.icpc.global/">ACM ICPC North America Championship</a> (which
occurs early in the spring), and
possibly even the <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/">ACM ICPC World Finals</a> (which
occurs later in the spring).</p>

<p>But the skills you will pick up from the course are far more valuable
than just enabling you to win contests.  Many of the algorithms and
techniques are classic ones that every computer scientist should know.
You will also learn to think about algorithms in a deeper way, because
many of the problems require you have to devise a new algorithm, not
just apply a classic one.  These skills will be of great value in your
other classes, in your job interviews, and in your future work.</p>

<h3>Week #13 - Number Theory</h3>

<p>Our last topic of the semester is number theory. We will focus a lot on prime numbers,
and factoring, which show up in competitions fairly often. These kinds of techniques are often
combined with counting problems, since sometimes you need to use clever number theory to
come up with ways to count certain objects efficiently and without double counting.</p>

<h3>Week #12 - Geometry</h3>

<p>We are on our second-last topic of the course, and its one that everybody either loves or hates... geometry! Geometry problems are often some of the most difficult problems that appear in programming competitions because they can be full of corner cases and rounding issues. This week, we will practice the fundamental techniques behind solving geometry problems.</p>

<h3>Week #11 - Advanced Data Structures</h3>

<p>This week we will cover some advanced data structures that you won't find in your
language's standard library. In particular, we will learn about data structures for
two very fundamental problems: Lowest common ancestors in trees, and ranged minimum
queries over arrays. It turns out that these two very different-sounding problems
can actually be reduced to one another and hence we can use the same data structures
to solve them.</p>

<h3>Week #8 -- Applications of Maximum Flow</h3>

<p>This week, we will explore even more graph algorithms. In particular, we will be looking
at applications of maximum network flow. One key difference compared to prior weeks is that
we will not actually focus on the algorithms for maximum flow (you should learn these in
your algorithms courses), but rather on the applications. It is therefore crucial that
you have a working implementation of a maximum flow algorithm ready to go before this
week's contest begins. A maximum flow code is an important component of any competitive
programmer's code library. If you have not learned a maximum flow algorithm before and
can not implement one yourself, you are allowed to use a prewritten implementation by
someone else. I will provide you with a sample C++ implementation that you are welcome
to use. The first of the practice problems this week will help you check your
implementation, as it simply asks you to compute a maximum flow in a graph, and not
solve any particular application. It is strongly recommended that you do this to avoid
getting wrong answers during the contest due to a bug in your flow code.</p>

<h3>Week #7 -- Mixed Contest</h3>

<p>This week, instead of focusing on a particular algorithmic topic, we will have
a contest that includes problems from the various topics that we have covered so
far. Specifically, expect to find problems on data structures, binary search,
dynamic programming, graphs, and shortest paths.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Week #6 -- Shortest Paths in Graphs</h3>

<p>This week, we will continue the theme of graph algorithms and talk about shortest
path problems in graphs. The fundamental algorithms that you will need to learn
to solve these kinds of problems are breadth-first search and Dijkstra's algorithm.
Other algorithms, such as Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall may also come in handy,
but are far less common.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Week #5: Graph Traversal</h3>

<p>This week we will talk about graph algorithms. This is a topic that will probably span
multiple weeks as we cover things like shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and
network flows. For this week, we will focus on the fundamentals, and cover things
like how to represent graphs and how to implement graph traversal algorithms.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Week #4: Dynamic programming</h3>

<p>This week, we will practice the use of dynamic programming (DP) as a technique to solve
programming competition problems. DP is quite possibly the most frequently occuring
algorithmic technique used in competitions, with every ICPC contest always featuring
at least one, if not several problems that require it. Masting this technique is key
to becoming a strong competitive programmer. DP revolves around two key concepts,
<em>optimal substructure</em>, which means that a problem can be solved by breaking it into
smaller versions of itself (much in the same way as divide and conquer), and
<em>memoization of overlapping subproblems</em>, which means to cache the solutions to
the smaller problems in case they need to be solved multiple times. Of all topics in
competitive programming, it probably requires the most practice in order to master, so get started!</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Week #3: Binary Search</h3>

<p>This week, we will solve problems that use the <em>binary search</em> technique. You might think
of binary search as an algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list, but it is actually
a much more general technique than that, and can be used to solve a wide range of problems.
Essentially, binary search allows you to solve problems where you must minimize or maximize
some quantity subject to some contraint, as long as that constraint is monotone. A constraint
is monotone if it is true/false for all values of x up to some value, and then becomes false/true
after that value. Binary search allows us to efficiently find this partition point, and hence
solve the corresponding optimization problem. The practice problems this week should help you
to learn to apply this powerfull technique.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Week #2: Fundamental Data Structures</h3>

<p>This week, we will focus on the most commonly used and fundamental data
structures in competitive programming. Specifically, we will review and
practice using arrays, binary search trees, hashtables, and priority
queues. Knowing and understanding how to use these data structures
in your favourite programming language is crucial to being able to
quickly implement solutions to problems. We will mainly use C++ to
demonstrate, but the ideas should be applicable to any language that
supports these data structures.</p>

<p>The three practice problems should give you some practice using
binary-search-tree-based data structures (set and map in C++, or
TreeSet and TreeMap in Java) and priority queues (priority_queue
in C++, or PriorityQueue in Java). As always, remember to register
for the practice contest via <a href="https://codeforces.com/group/KIrM1Owd8u/contests">this page</a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Week #1: Introduction</h3>

<p>This week has no particular algorithmic theme. Instead, we will go
over the basics of competitive programming and do our first contest on
Codeforces. Please make sure you have a Codeforces account ready to go
and understand how to upload your solutions to the problems.  You
should do some practice problems to get the hang of writing and
submitting solutions to the Codeforces system.</p>

<p>We have created a practice contest to do just that.  So go to <a href="https://codeforces.com/group/KIrM1Owd8u/contests">this
page</a> and (1) join
the group (right side) (2) register for the contest and (3) enter the
contest.  Then you will find three problems you can try to solve.  The
are: <em>Lights in the Morning</em>, <em>Deconstructed Password</em> and <em>Fine-tuned
Resistance</em>.<br /></p>

<h2><a name="grading"></a> Grading</h2>

<p>This course is 5 units.  Each week you will be given several problems
to try to solve during class.  You will be allowed (for half credit)
to solve these problems during the week after the contest ends.  You
can also get credit for solving problems during rated contests on
Codeforces.  (This site run rated contests approximately every two
weeks.)</p>

<p>To be more specific, you can earn points from the following sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>Solving problems during the in-class contests. Each problem you solve is worth one point</li>
<li>Solving problems from the in-class contests during the week following the contest. Each problem solved in this way is worth 0.5 points</li>
<li>Solving problems during rated competitions on Codeforces. Division 3 contests and Problem A from Division 2 contests are not counted. You will earn one point for each problem solved.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is how your grade is determined:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>score &ge; 25: A <br>
score &ge; 15: B <br>
score &ge; 10: C <br>
score &ge; &nbsp; 5: D <br></p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="rules"></a> Rules</h2>

<p>You can make use of generic on-line resources while solving problems.
These include things like language documentation, API documentation,
algorithm descriptions, terminology, etc.  You should not search for
or make use of code written by others to solve the specific assigned
problem.</p>

<p>If you're stuck on a problem, you are welcome to discuss it with
another student in the class, or the course staff.  Keep the level
down so as not to disturb those around you.</p>

<h2><a name="logistics"></a> Logistics</h2>
