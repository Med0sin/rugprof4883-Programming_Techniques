<h1>15-295: Competition Programming and Problem Solving, Spring 2016</h1>

<p>In this course you will learn the techniques and skills needed to
solve algorithmic programming contests problems such as those that
appear on the <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/">ACM ICPC</a>,
<a href="http://www.codeforces.com">Codeforces</a>, and
<a href="https://www.topcoder.com/community/events/">Topcoder</a>.
Most of your time will be spent writing programs on your own
to solve problems.</p>

<p>But the skills you will pick up from the course are far more valuable
than just enabling you to win contests.  Many of the algorithms and
techniques are classic ones that every computer scientist should know.
You will also learn to think about algorithms in a deeper way, because
many of the problems require you have to devise a new algorithm, not
just apply a classic one.  These skills will be of great value in your
other classes, in your job interviews, and in your future work.</p>

<h2>Team Training Contests</h2>

<p>Here are a few of the problem sets used for team training this spring:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeforces.com/gym/100792/attachments/download/3790/statements.pdf">NEERC Moscow Subregional 2015</a><br>
<a href="http://www.codeforces.com/gym/100801/attachments/download/3802/20152016-acmicpc-neerc-northern-subregional-contest-en.pdf">NEERC Northern Subregional 2015</a></p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>This course is 5 units.  Each week you will be given several problems
to try to solve during class.  You will be allowed (for half credit)
to solve these problems during the week after the contest ends.  You
can also get credit for solving problems during rated contests on
Codeforces and Topcoder.  (These sites run rated contests
approximately every two weeks.)</p>

<p>Let me be more specific.  Each problem that we give has some number
of points between 1 and 3. Let X be the total number of points of the
problems you solve in class.  Let X' be the total number points of
the problems you solve in the week after class.  Let Y be the number
of Codeforces problems you solve and let Z be the number of topcoder
problems you solve.  (Y and Z only count problems solved during
rated contests.)  Your score in the course is X + X'/2 + Y + Z.</p>

<p>Here is how your grade is determined:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>score &ge; 25: A <br>
score &ge; 15: B <br>
score &ge; 10: C <br>
score &ge; &nbsp; 5: D <br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you do a Codeforces or TopCoder rated contest, please email me
that you have done it so that I can incorporate that into your grade.
For Codeforces problems in Div 2, problems A and B are 1 point and the
rest are 2 points.  For Codeforces Div 1 and TopCoder all problems are
2 points.</p>

<p>There's one more twist to the system.  If you've taken the class
before, then you will not get credit for 1 point problems.  You can
still do them for fun, but you should be focusing on the harder
problems.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>You can make use of generic on-line resources while solving problems.
These include things like language documentation, API documentation,
algorithm descriptions, terminology, etc.  You should not search for
or make use of code written by others to solve the specific assigned
problem.</p>

<p>If you're stuck on a problem, you are welcome to discuss it with
another student in the class, or the course staff.  Keep the level
down so as not to disturb those around you.</p>

<p>During the selection rounds (see below), discussion with
classmates is not allowed.  Clarifications can be obtained from the
course staff.</p>

<h2>Logistics</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Everyone in 15-295 and/or on any programming team should be in 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/15-295">http://groups.google.com/group/15-295</a>.
This is how we communicate with the class.</p></li>
<li><p>Everybody in the class is required to have a Codeforces account.
We will be running our weekly contests on the Codeforces
website via a mechanism called "mashups".  If you do not already
have an account on Codeforces, <a href="http://codeforces.com/register">please create one</a>.  And add your
name along with your Codeforces handle name to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oIdleCpmb50Aq335LXujdCX3X9KaCuSruVtnGPVBU00/edit?usp=sharing">this google doc</a>. (It's the same one in Basic Information list above.)</p></li>
<li><p>As we proceed through the semester we will tabulate your results and put them into
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UCmPDLoyJbT07VGk-WIOmh-6f-5vfpKsgCW4GZOsVNE/edit?usp=sharing">this document</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a laptop bring it to class.  If you don't you will have
to work in one of the clusters.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is demand we may also set up a piazza page for the course.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>There are a number of excellent tutorials on the algorithms and
techniques needed to solve these kinds of contest programs on
<a href="https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/">Topcoder's Data Science Tutorials web
site</a>.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact (email or stop by) the instructor or the TA any time
to discuss problems, including during class.</p>

<h2>Being on an ACM ICPC Team</h2>

<p>We typically send five teams of three to the <a href="http://acm-ecna.ysu.edu/">ACM ECNA regional
event</a>.  This year it will take place on
Saturday October 31 (Halloween).  We drive to Youngstown on Friday
afternoon, stay in a hotel, do the contest on Saturday, and return
in the early evening on Saturday night.</p>

<p>The teams will be selected based on the results of two contests which
will take place during regular class times on September 16th and
September 23rd.  I am only considering undergraduate students who are
eligible to go to the World Finals (you can't go to the world finals
more than two times).  The World Finals will take place in Bangkok
Thailand, May 15-20, 2016.  If you are interested in trying to be on a
team, it is imperitive that you participate and do well in the two
selection rounds on Sept. 16th and 23rd.</p>
