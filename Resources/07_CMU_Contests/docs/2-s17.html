<h1>15-295: Competition Programming and Problem Solving, Spring 2017</h1>

<p>In this course you will learn the techniques and skills needed to
solve algorithmic programming contests problems such as those that
appear on the <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/">ACM ICPC</a>,
<a href="http://www.codeforces.com">Codeforces</a>, and
<a href="https://www.topcoder.com/community/events/">Topcoder</a>.
Most of your time will be spent writing programs on your own
to solve problems.</p>

<p>But the skills you will pick up from the course are far more valuable
than just enabling you to win contests.  Many of the algorithms and
techniques are classic ones that every computer scientist should know.
You will also learn to think about algorithms in a deeper way, because
many of the problems require you have to devise a new algorithm, not
just apply a classic one.  These skills will be of great value in your
other classes, in your job interviews, and in your future work.</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>This course is 5 units.  Each week you will be given several problems
to try to solve during class.  You will be allowed (for half credit)
to solve these problems during the week after the contest ends.  You
can also get credit for solving problems during rated contests on
Codeforces.  (The site runs rated contests approximately every two
weeks.)</p>

<p>Let me be more specific.  Each problem that we give has some number
of points between 1 and 3. Let X be the total number of points of the
problems you solve in class.  Let X' be the total number points of
the problems you solve in the week after class.  Let Y be the number
of Codeforces problems you solve.  (Y only counts problems solved
during rated contests.)  Your score in the course is X + X'/2 + Y.</p>

<p>Here is how your grade is determined:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>score &ge; 25: A <br>
score &ge; 15: B <br>
score &ge; 10: C <br>
score &ge; &nbsp; 5: D <br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you do a Codeforces rated contest, please email me that you have
done it so that I can incorporate that into your grade.  Each problem
is one point.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>You can make use of generic on-line resources while solving problems.
These include things like language documentation, API documentation,
algorithm descriptions, terminology, etc.  You should not search for
or make use of code written by others to solve the specific assigned
problem.</p>

<p>If you're stuck on a problem, you are welcome to discuss it with
another student in the class, or the course staff.  Keep the level
down so as not to disturb those around you.</p>

<h2>Logistics</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Everyone in 15-295 and/or on any programming team should be in 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/15-295">http://groups.google.com/group/15-295</a>.
This is how we communicate with the class.</p></li>
<li><p>Everybody in the class is required to have a Codeforces account.
We will be running our weekly contests on the Codeforces
website via a mechanism called "mashups".  If you do not already
have an account on Codeforces, <a href="http://codeforces.com/register">please create one</a>.  And add your
name along with your Codeforces handle name to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/136SZh_RgVDRgydVT0bBBZoo95OOTCKWqGmmGxsvObpU/edit?usp=sharing">this google doc</a>. (It's the same one in Basic Information list above.)</p></li>
<li><p>To join the 15-295 codeforces group, first create your codeforces account.
Then go to this <a href="http://codeforces.com/group/KIrM1Owd8u/contests">15-295
Codeforces Group</a>
page.  On this page you should see a list of the contests created for
this course.</p>

<p>After you've logged in with your codeforces account and clicked the
link above to get to the group page, toward the right side of the
page click on the link to join the group.  (You only have to join
once.)  Then a "Register" link should appear next to the contest.
Click on this link to register for the contest.  After that another
"Enter" link should be available for you to join the contest (if it
has already started).</p></li>
<li><p>As we proceed through the semester we will tabulate your results and put them into
the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ccDXb1xEBIaUt43dgmxHEG7eG6SfdZltxh_H27AECn8/edit?usp=sharing">grades</a>
document mentioned above.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a laptop bring it to class.  If you don't you will have
to work in one of the clusters.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is demand we may also set up a piazza page for the course.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>A great way to get started and to improve is via the <a href="http://train.usaco.org/usacogate">USACO training
site</a>.  They've developed a series
of lessons along with corresponding problems.  It will take you from a
beginner to a strong contest programmer.</p>

<p>There are a number of excellent tutorials on the algorithms and
techniques needed to solve these kinds of contest programs on
<a href="https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/">Topcoder's Data Science Tutorials web
site</a>.</p>

<p>You can also do old problems on codeforces.  Just go to
<a href="codeforces.com/contests">codeforces.com/contests</a> and click "enter"
on any of the contests.  You can then try solving problems.  You can
also go to the scoreboard of the contest and click on other people's
solutions to see their code.  This is a great way to learn.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact (email or stop by) the instructor or the TA any time
to discuss problems, including during class.</p>

<p>Here are a few tutorials about important algorithms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="../tutorials/seg_tree.cc">A segment tree implementation and tutorial</a>. <br>
<a href="../tutorials/min-cost-flow.txt">Lecture Notes about min cost flow, along with an implementaiton.</a> <br>
<a href="../tutorials/union-find.txt">Union-Find Lecture Notes</a>. <br>
<a href="../tutorials/range_tree.txt">Range Trees (AKA Fenwick Trees)</a> <br>
<a href="http://codeforces.com/contest/117/submission/860934">Link-Cut Trees</a> (See detailed comments in this codeforces submission.) <br></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Being on an ACM ICPC Team</h2>

<p>In the fall we form several teams of three (based on performance in
qualifying contests).  These teams then go to the <a href="http://acm-ecna.ysu.edu/">ACM ECNA regional
event</a>.  The best performing two or three
teams are then invited to go to the <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/">World
Finals</a> in an exotic location.  (At most one
team from any given school is allowed to attend.)</p>
