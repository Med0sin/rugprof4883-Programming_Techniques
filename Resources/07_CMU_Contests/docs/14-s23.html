<h1>Competition Programming and Problem Solving</h1>

<h2>15-195 and 15-295 Spring 2023</h2>

<p>In this course you will learn the techniques and skills needed to
solve algorithmic programming contests problems such as those that
appear on the <a href="http://icpc.global/">ICPC</a>,
<a href="http://www.codeforces.com">Codeforces</a>, <a href="https://dmoj.ca/">DMOJ</a>, and
<a href="https://atcoder.jp/">AtCoder</a>.  Much of your
time will be spent writing programs on your own to solve problems.</p>

<p>But the skills you will pick up from the course are far more valuable
than just enabling you to win contests.  Many of the algorithms and
techniques are classic ones that every computer scientist should know.
You will also learn to think about algorithms in a deeper way, because
many of the problems require you have to devise a new algorithm, not
just apply a classic one.  You will also become highly fluent in a
programming language of your choice.  These skills will be of great
value in your other classes, in your job interviews, and in your
future work, not to mention the satisfaction you will get from solving
these problems.</p>

<h3>Week #4 (February 8): Dynamic programming</h3>

<p>This week, we will practice the use of dynamic programming (DP) as a technique to solve
programming competition problems. DP is quite possibly the most frequently occuring
algorithmic technique used in competitions, with every ICPC contest always featuring
at least one, if not several problems that require it. Mastering this technique is key
to becoming a strong competitive programmer. DP revolves around two key concepts,
<em>optimal substructure</em>, which means that a problem can be solved by breaking it into
smaller versions of itself (much in the same way as divide and conquer), and
<em>memoization of overlapping subproblems</em>, which means to cache the solutions to
the smaller problems in case they need to be solved multiple times. Of all topics in
competitive programming, it probably requires the most practice in order to master, so get started!</p>

<h3>Week #3 (February 1): Binary Search</h3>

<p>This week, we will solve problems that use the <em>binary search</em> technique. You might think
of binary search as an algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list, but it is actually
a much more general technique than that, and can be used to solve a wide range of problems.
Essentially, binary search allows you to solve problems where you must minimize or maximize
some quantity subject to some contraint, as long as that constraint is monotone. A constraint
is monotone if it is false for all values of x up to some value, and then becomes true
after that value. Binary search allows us to efficiently find this partition point, and hence
solve the corresponding optimization problem. The practice problems this week should help you
to learn to apply this powerfull technique.</p>

<h3>Week #2 (January 25): Built-in Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>

<p>This week there will be no overall theme, but there will be some
problems that will benefit from knowing how to use common built-in
data structures, such as pairs, ordered sets (binary search trees),
maps (hash tables), and priority queues.  Check out the
lecture linked below by Daniel Anderson which talks about 
how to use these features of C++.</p>

<h3>Week #1 (January 18): Introduction</h3>

<p>This week has no particular algorithmic theme. Instead, we will go
over the basics of competitive programming and do our first contest on
DMOJ.  Please make sure you have a DMOJ account ready to go and
understand how to upload your solutions to the problems.
We have created a practice contest to do just that.  You should
do some practice problems to get the hang of writing and submitting
solutions to the DMOJ system.</p>

<p>See the logistics section below to set up your DMOJ account, and
join "Carnegie Mellon University".</p>

<p>If you don't know how to read from
standard input and write to standard output,
<a href="https://contest.cs.cmu.edu/295/tutorials/stdin-out-in-all-languages.txt">here's</a>
a tutorial showing how to do it.</p>

<h2><a name="rules"></a> Rules and Academic Integrity</h2>

<p>You can make use of generic on-line resources while solving problems.
These include things like language documentation, API documentation,
algorithm descriptions, terminology, etc.  You <em>are allowed</em> to use
any code you have written, at any time in the past, for any purpose.
However, you <em>should not</em> search for or make use of code written by
others to solve the specific assigned problem.  You're allowed to
copy somewhat standard pieces of code (e.g. a primality test) that
you find on-line or in a book.</p>

<p>So to summarize, each student should write his or her own code.  If
you're stuck on a problem, you are welcome to discuss it with another
student in the class, or the course staff.  But you cannot copy
another student's code.</p>

<p>The violations described above are regarded as an academic integrity
violation, and -- depending on the severity -- will result in
penalties and/or be reported to the appropriate university
authorities.</p>

<h2><a name="grading"></a> Grading</h2>

<p>This course is 5 units.  Each week you will be given several problems
to try to solve during class.  You will be allowed (for half credit)
to solve these problems during the week after the contest ends.  You
can also get credit for solving problems during rated contests on
Codeforces.  (This site run rated contests approximately every two
weeks.)</p>

<p>To be more specific, you can earn points from the following sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>Solving problems during the in-class contests. Each problem you
solve is worth one point</li>
<li>Solving problems from the in-class contests during the week
following the contest. Each problem solved in this way is worth 0.5
points</li>
<li>Solving problems during rated competitions on Codeforces. (Division 3
contests and Problem A from Division 2 contests are not counted.) You
will earn one point for each problem solved.</li>
</ul>

<p>The differences between 15-195 and 15-295 are:
Students enrolled in 15-295 will not get credit for problems A and B
of the weekly contests, but 15-195 students can.  A student can take
15-195 only once, but 15-295 can be taken repeatedly.</p>

<p>Here is how your grade is determined:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>score &ge; 25: A <br>
score &ge; 15: B <br>
score &ge; 10: C <br>
score &ge; &nbsp; 5: D <br></p>
</blockquote>

</ul>

<h2><a name="diversity"></a> Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h2>

<p><em>We must treat every individual with respect.</em> We are diverse in many
ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an
equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to
multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to
race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual
orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief,
veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse
identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the
perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We,
at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only
because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want
to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also
fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of
building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces
these core values.</p>

<p>Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether
intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an
unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the
university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who
experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of
identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of
the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these
experiences using the following resources:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li>Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: &lt;<a href="&#x6D;&#97;il&#116;&#x6F;:c&#115;&#x64;&#105;&#64;&#x61;&#x6E;&#x64;&#114;&#x65;w&#x2E;&#x63;m&#x75;&#46;&#101;&#100;&#117;">c&#115;&#x64;&#105;&#64;&#x61;&#x6E;&#x64;&#114;&#x65;w&#x2E;&#x63;m&#x75;&#46;&#101;&#100;&#117;</a>>, (412) 268-2150 </br ></li>
<li>Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: <a href="http://reportit.net">reportit.net</a> username: tartans password: plaid </br ></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there
should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the
university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus
climate to be more equitable and just.</p>
